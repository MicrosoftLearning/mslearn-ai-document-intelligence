# Extract Data from Forms

Suppose a company currently requires employees to manually purchase order sheets and enter the data into a database. They would like you to utilize AI services to improve the data entry process. You decide to build a machine learning model that will read the form and produce structured data that can be used to automatically update a database.

**Azure AI Document Intelligence** is an Azure AI service that enables users to build automated data processing software. This software can extract text, key/value pairs, and tables from form documents using optical character recognition (OCR). Azure AI Document Intelligence has pre-built models for recognizing invoices, receipts, and business cards. The service also provides the capability to train custom models. In this exercise, we will focus on building custom models.

## Prepare to develop an app in Visual Studio Code

Now let's use the service SDK to develop an app using Visual Studio Code. The code files for your app have been provided in a GitHub repo.

> **Tip**: If you have already cloned the **mslearn-ai-document-intelligence** repo, open it in Visual Studio code. Otherwise, follow these steps to clone it to your development environment.

1. Start Visual Studio Code.
1. Open the palette (SHIFT+CTRL+P) and run a **Git: Clone** command to clone the `https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-document-intelligence` repository to a local folder (it doesn't matter which folder).
1. When the repository has been cloned, open the folder in Visual Studio Code.

    > **Note**: If Visual Studio Code shows you a pop-up message to prompt you to trust the code you are opening, click on **Yes, I trust the authors** option in the pop-up.

1. Wait while additional files are installed to support the C# code projects in the repo.

    > **Note**: If you are prompted to add required assets to build and debug, select **Not Now**. If you are prompted with the Message *Detected an Azure Function Project in folder*, you can safely close that message.

## Create a Azure AI Document Intelligence resource

To use the Azure AI Document Intelligence service, you need a Azure AI Document Intelligence or Azure AI Services resource in your Azure subscription. You'll use the Azure portal to create a resource.

1. In a browser tab, open the Azure portal at `https://portal.azure.com`, signing in with the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription.
1. On the Azure portal home page, navigate to the top search box and type **Document Intelligence** and then press **Enter**.
1. On the **Document Intelligence** page, select **Create**.
1. On the **Create Document Intelligence** page, use the following to configure your resource:
    - **Subscription**: Your Azure subscription.
    - **Resource group**: Select or create a resource group with a unique name such as *DocIntelligenceResources*.
    - **Region**: select a region near you.
    - **Name**: Enter a globally unique name.
    - **Pricing tier**: select **Free F0** (if you don't have a Free tier available, select **Standard S0**).
1. Then select **Review + create**, and **Create**. Wait while Azure creates the Azure AI Document Intelligence resource.
1. When the deployment is complete, select **Go to resource** to view the resource's **Overview** page. 

## Gather documents for training

You'll use the sample forms such as this one to train a test a model: 

![An image of an invoice used in this project.](../media/Form_1.jpg)

1. Return to **Visual Studio Code**. In the *Explorer* pane, open the **Labfiles/02-custom-document-intelligence** folder and  expand the **sample-forms** folder. Notice there are files ending in **.json** and **.jpg** in the folder.

    You will use the **.jpg** files to train your model.  

    The **.json** files have been generated for you and contain label information. The files will be uploaded into your blob storage container alongside the forms.

    You can view the images we are using in the *sample-forms* folder by selecting them on Visual Studio Code.

1. Return to the **Azure portal** and navigate to your resource's **Overview** page if you're not already there. Under the *Essentials* section, view the **Resource group** in which you created the Document Intelligence resource.

1. On the **Overview** page for your resource group, note the **Subscription ID** and **Location**. You will need these values, along with your **resource group** name in subsequent steps.

    ![An example of the resource group page.](../media/resource_group_variables.png)

1. In Visual Studio Code, in the *Explorer* pane, browse to the **Labfiles/02-custom-document-intelligence** folder and expand the **CSharp** or **Python** folder depending on your language preference. Each folder contains the language-specific files for an app into which you're you're going to integrate Azure OpenAI functionality.

1. Right-click the **CSharp** or **Python** folder containing your code files and select **Open an integrated terminal**. 

1. In the terminal, run the following command to login to Azure. The **az login** command will open the Microsoft Edge browser, login with the same account you used to create the Azure AI Document Intelligence resource. Once you are logged in, close the browser window.

    ```powershell
    az login
    ```

1. Return to Visual Studio Code. In the terminal pane, run the following command to list the Azure locations.

    ```powershell
    az account list-locations -o table
    ```

1. In the output, find the **Name** value that corresponds with the location of your resource group (for example, for *East US* the corresponding name is *eastus*).

    > **Important**: Record the **Name** value and use it in Step 11.

1. In Visual Studio Code, in the **Labfiles/02-custom-document-intelligence** folder, select **setup.cmd**. You will use this script to run the Azure command line interface (CLI) commands required to create the other Azure resources you need.

1. In the **setup.cmd** script, review the commands. The program will:
    - Create a storage account in your Azure resource group
    - Upload files from your local *sampleforms* folder to a container called *sampleforms* in the storage account
    - Print a Shared Access Signature URI

1. Modify the **subscription_id**, **resource_group**, and **location** variable declarations with the appropriate values for the subscription, resource group, and location name where you deployed the Document Intelligence resource.
Then **save** your changes.

    Leave the **expiry_date** variable as it is for the exercise. This variable is used when generating the Shared Access Signature (SAS) URI. In practice, you will want to set an appropriate expiry date for your SAS. You can learn more about SAS [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview#how-a-shared-access-signature-works).  

1. In the terminal for the **Labfiles/02-custom-document-intelligence** folder, enter the following command to run the script:

    ```PowerShell
    $currentdir=(Get-Item .).FullName
    cd ..
    ./setup.cmd
    cd $currentdir

    ```

1. When the script completes, review the displayed output.

1. In the Azure portal, refresh your resource group and verify that it contains the Azure Storage account just created. Open the storage account and in the pane on the left, select **Storage browser**. Then in Storage Browser, expand **Blob containers** and select the **sampleforms** container to verify that the files have been uploaded from your local **02-custom-document-intelligence/sample-forms** folder.

## Train the model using Document Intelligence Studio

Now you will train the model using the files uploaded to the storage account.

1. In your browser, navigate to the Document Intelligence Studio at `https://documentintelligence.ai.azure.com/studio`.
1. Scroll down to the **Custom models** section and select the **Custom extraction model** tile.
1. If you are asked to sign into your account, use your Azure credentials.
1. If you are asked which Azure AI Document Intelligence resource to use, select the subscription and resource name you used when you created the Azure AI Document Intelligence resource.
1. Under **My Projects**, select **Create a project**. Use the following configurations:

    - **Project name**: Enter a unique name.
        - Select *Continue*.
    - **Configure service resource**: Select the subscription, resource group, and document intelligence resource you created previously in this lab. Check the *Set as default* box. Keep the default API version. 
        - Select *Continue*.
    - **Connect training data source**: Select the subscription, resource group, and storage account that was created by the setup script. Check the *Set as default* box. Select the `sampleforms` blob container, and leave the folder path blank.
        - Select *Continue*.
    - Select *Create project*

1. Once your project is created, select **Train** to train your model. Use the following configurations:
    - **Model ID**: *Provide a globally unique name (you'll need the model ID name in the next step)*. 
    - **Build Mode**: Template.
1. Training can take some time. You'll see a notification when it's complete.

## Test your custom Document Intelligence model

1. Return to Visual Studio Code. In the terminal, install the Document Intelligence package by running the appropriate command for your language preference:

    **C#**:

    ```powershell
    dotnet add package Azure.AI.FormRecognizer --version 4.1.0
    ```

    **Python**:

    ```powershell
    pip install azure-ai-formrecognizer==3.3.0
    ```

1. In Visual Studio Code, in the **Labfiles/02-custom-document-intelligence** folder, select the language you are using. Edit the configuration file (**appsettings.json** or **.env**, depending on your language preference) with the following values:
    - Your Document Intelligence endpoint.
    - Your Document Intelligence key.
    - The Model ID generated you provided when training your model. You can find this on the **Models** page of the Document Intelligence Studio. **Save** your changes.

1. In Visual Studio Code, open the code file for your client application (*Program.cs* for C#, *test-model.py* for Python) and review the code it contains, particularly that the image in the URL refers to the file in this GitHub repo on the web.

1. Return the terminal, and enter the following command to run the program:

    **C#**

    ```powershell
    dotnet build
    dotnet run
    ```

    **Python**

    ```powershell
    python test-model.py
    ```

1. View the output and observe how the output for the model provides field names like `Merchant` and `CompanyPhoneNumber`.

## Clean up

If you're done with your Azure resource, remember to delete the resource in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/?azure-portal=true) to avoid further charges.
